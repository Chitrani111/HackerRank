'''You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. 
Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.
Complete the Student class by writing the following:
  1- A Student class constructor, which has  parameters:
      a- A string, firstName.
      b- A string, lastName.
      c- An integer, idNumber.
      d- An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
  2- A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
          Grading Scale
        Letter    Avg(a)
          O     90<=avg<=100
          E     80<=avg<=90
          A     70<=avg<=80
          P     55<=avg<=70
          D     40<=avg<=55
          T        a<40
